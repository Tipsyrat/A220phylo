        "First and foremost, organisms are arranged into ranks based on trait similarities (homologies) that reflect evolutionary relationships. Subsequently, this led another group of scientists, known as systematics to hypothesise evolutionary relationships based on patterns of similarities. We learned that systematists use phylogenetic trees or graphically represent hypothesised evolutionary relationships. </br>\n",
